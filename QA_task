5. Click on "Поиск" button. 
6. There is first mistake in choosing "Kласс": "Эконом" and "Премиум-эконом", it looks like you can choose only one them, because, you pop on each one, but not marking(#1.)
7. I also have question to currency (#4. and #6.). There are "USD" and "€". It is high priority. 
8. (#2.) Not correct city in field "Kyдa дaльше?". Change "Житомир" to "Барселона". 
9. Field "Обратно" should be empty(#3.). 
10. There is return option(#8.), because of step 9.
11. Above "Багаж", on field "Ручная кладь" should choose "1"(#7.)
12. In object "Tpaнcпopт" unmark "Автобус" (#5.)
Actual result: I hope, that you will come to Barcelona after border opening
Expected result. It look like you can do this in July
